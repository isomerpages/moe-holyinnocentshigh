### **Principal's Message**

#### **Principal’s Foreword 2022**

We believe that at HIHS, all students and teachers are anchored in a Christ-centred community, where values of integrity, humility, respect and love fill our shared experiences. I am privileged to journey with the students in their preparation for an adventure of life, where each will carry away something always very precious from their growing-up years at HIHS, into their career paths. 

Thank you, parents and guardians, for choosing this school for an education second to none.

This year, the school celebrates 130 years of nurturing our best talents with an education started by the Catholic fathers in the Punggol /Upper Serangoon area. Thanks to the pioneering fathers’ and educators’ indomitable faith and steadfast vision, many students from diverse backgrounds have the opportunity to give back in their community efforts, deepening their understanding of reciprocity in a community of care and love.

With gratitude, we pray that every child, who passes through the portals of HIHS, will have the moral courage to make right decisions, walk with radiant confidence and have the tenacity of purpose to be imbued with a loving heart for others. Each student deserves the best in education, and we are very proud to present young people who have the courage to lead and compassion to serve.
