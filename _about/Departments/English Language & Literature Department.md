### **English Language & Literature Department**

#### **Department Philosophy**
To prepare our students to thrive in the 21st Century, our teachers use an integrative approach to Media Education, anchored on the schoolâ€™s Applied Learning Programme in Journalism & Broadcasting. The students are taught and assessed by using a variety of media tools and platforms in the English Language classroom.

Our teachers work in teams to design lessons and assessment tasks for their levels, in close alignment to the national EL Syllabus. The lessons are based on relevant current issues, using the platform of multimodal literacies, which are essential in enhancing their comprehension skills and helping them to achieve a deeper appreciation of the world around them by nurturing in them significant moral values.

At the same time, the department also focusses on building a strong foundation and providing a rich language for all in the following areas of language learning.
