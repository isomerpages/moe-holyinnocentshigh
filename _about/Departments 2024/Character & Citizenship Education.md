#### **Cyberwellness**

The Cyberwellness programmes aims to guide students in taking responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’ (Ethics Character), ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ (Ethics Character) and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ (Service Character) when adhered to will help our students in cyberspace as they will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions. The HIHS continual emphasis is on making decisions guided by the school values.

The Cyberwellness curriculum include lessons and learning experiences including roadshows and assembly programmes on cyber well-being, Cyberwellness advocacy movement by students, and customised training to equip our students with the necessary skills to adopt healthy cyber habits.

#### **National Education**

National Education plays an important role in the school’s overall CCE efforts. Besides commemorating the four NE events, students have the opportunity to learn about various cultures and religions through learning journeys, assembly programmes, and customised activities held as part of the formal CCE curriculum. In the process, they also deepen their understanding of the role they play as active citizens in Singapore.
