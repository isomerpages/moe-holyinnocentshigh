#### **HI Dads For Life**

In HIHS, we recognise the important role which fathers play in inspiring and becoming good influences in their children’s lives – for life!

Besides our Parent Support Group, we are also partnering Centre for Fathering to embark on the **HI Dads for Life Movement** through a series of father<br>
– child bonding activities, talks, and networking sessions for fathers. We welcome fathers to join us in our journey!

Look out on Parents Gateway for announcements about our upcoming activities!
