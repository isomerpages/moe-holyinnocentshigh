Journalism and Broadcasting (J&B) at Holy Innocents’ High School (HIHS) has been awarded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) status in January 2015. <br>The school’s mission and vision articulate our aspirations<br> to nurture students who will lead with courage and serve<br> with compassion, guided by our core values of humility,<br> integrity, respect and love. Our ALP in Journalism &<br> Broadcast would grow a generation of students who are<br> critical thinkers who exude confidence and can<br> communicate well.

Through their voices, whether in written or aural form, our students can influence society and contribute towards the building of a nation that is compassionate, caring and forward-looking. In the J&B Programme, pupils learn information gathering, interview and reporting skills, journalistic writing, oralcy skills, etc. These will help them build their portfolio in J&B and put them in good stead to develop a career in media and communications.

#### **Curriculum and Programmes**

Leveraging on the school’s strengths and partnerships, our Journalism & Broadcast is anchored in the Chinese Language (CL). Broad-based opportunities for Sec 1 and 2 students are provided through the offering of Basic Journalism and Broadcasting Curriculum through weekly enrichment (in Chinese Language) and modular approach (in English Language). Each year, core skills and concepts will be taught through the main curriculum conducted in Chinese while a five-week introductory module will be taught in English to introduce/revise the other aspects of Journalism and Broadcasting.

Lesson packages are designed and conducted by each <br>department’s teachers. Opportunities to apply their <br>knowledge and skills learnt will be provided at different <br>platforms in both languages, as well as other subject<br> disciplines. These include weekly DJ broadcasts and class <br>broadcasts, class newsletter, publications in Lianhe Zaobao,<br> national competitions, etc.
