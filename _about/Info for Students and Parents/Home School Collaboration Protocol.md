### **Home School Collaboration Protocol**

##### **Character Development and Social-Emotional Well-Being**

| Areas | In School: | At home: |
|---|---|---|
| General Discipline  | Form Teachers (FT) are the key liaison persons with parents. On the first day of school, FT will brief students on the school rules printed in the Student Handbook. The school expects students to abide by school rules at all times, and uphold the image of the school through their attitudes, behaviour and actions. | Parents may read the Student Handbook and ensure their children follow the school rules (especially on attire and personal grooming and the usage of mobile phone or other electronic devices brought to school). |
| Serious Offences e.g. Cheating/Truancy  | FT or Discipline Teachers (DT) will inform parents if their children are involved in serious offences. <br><br>Depending on the nature of the offences, parents may be asked to meet FT/DT in school to discuss how parents and school can collaborate to adopt measures to help the student learn from the offence. Where necessary, appropriate punishment will be meted out and students sent for counselling. | Parents should work closely with the school to help their children change their undesirable behaviours. Parents should take time and effort to counsel their children, help them process the circumstances of the impact of their actions on self and others through reflection, and encourage them to do the right thing. If their children are suspended, parents should ensure that their children stay at home during the suspension period, and bring their children back to school once the suspension period is over. |
| Minor Offences e.g. late-coming less than 5 times  | The school and teachers will endeavour to correct misbehaviour by adopting a counselling and restorative approach, encourage students to reflect over what they have not done correctly, and take steps to restore any broken relationships. Consequences may be meted out for minor offences, with possibilities including detention, reflection, apologies, and other appropriate consequences. FT will inform parents on the students’ offences and the consequences. | Parents should work with their children to process the incidents where possible, help their children understand the different perspectives experienced by the various parties involved, and help them understand how their behaviour and actions may have hurt themselves or others in some instances. |
|Absenteeism | The school will contact parents via phone call or messaging each time the child is absent. When a student returns to school after his/her absence, FT will request for the medical certificate (MC) and/or parent’s letter. Disciplinary actions may be meted out if students are absent without valid reasons. A 0 mark will be given for absence in Weighted Assessment (WA) and Semestral Assessment (SA), without official MC. While parent’s letters are accepted, except for WA and SA, the school will only accept up to a maximum of 2 letters per semester to explain for a child’s absence. |Parents/Students should inform the school before 7.25 am if they are unable to attend school where possible. If students are unwell, parents are encouraged to bring their children to consult a doctor and request for a MC. MCs must be submitted to the FT immediately when their children return to school. Likewise, other official documents or excuse letters for other valid leave of absence (e.g. demise of relatives) should be submitted to the FT for records. Only letters signed by parents or legal guardians will be accepted.|
|Late-coming|A message will be sent to the parents each time the child is late for school. The consequences for late-coming are spelt out in the Student Handbook.|Parents may help to ensure that their children wake up and leave home on time so that they are punctual for school. It will be helpful if parents could work with their children to develop the habit of punctuality.Parents are strongly encouraged to download the SNAAPP app in their smartphone to monitor their children’s attendance in school, and receive messages from the school.|
|Counselling|The school has Counsellors and an Allied Educator (Learning and Behavioural Support) to help students with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, specific learning issues, and also assist those who are feeling stressed and/or have unique social-emotional needs.|It will be helpful for parents to inform the school or FT on their children’s conditions/special learning needs, if any, at the beginning of the year. Parents may also discuss with FT and request for their children to see the Allied Educators for social-emotional support when necessary.|
|Values-In-Action (VIA) Projects|The school will plan VIA projects for students to serve the community meaningfully. All students will be given autonomy to plan VIA projects, under the guidance of FTs. VIA also serves as a platform for students to hone their leadership skills through the Good Samaritan Programme.|Parents may discuss the VIA projects with their children to help them reflect on their learning. Parents may also join the Parent Support Group (PSG) if they wish to take part in VIA projects with their children.|
|School Camps|The school will organise level camps for Sec 1 to 5 students every year. These camps provide opportunities for bonding between students and teachers. They also inculcate in students important attributes such as resilience and self-discipline, and provide enrichment experiences to help them think and discover their aspirations and interests. Camps are compulsory and are an integral part of the school curriculum to enrich students’ learning experience.<br> <br>Faith formation for the whole school involves imbuing a sense of purpose and personal mission in our students.|Parents should encourage their children to attend the camps, which would help build their character and pick up life skills.<br><br>They may also share with their children any good camping experiences they may have had.|
|Faith Formation|For Catholic students, faith formation also entails a progressive journey of discipleship to encounter God and to acquire knowledge and understanding of Christ's teaching, ultimately growing to become a witness to Christ when they leave the school. Catholic activities include participation in a non-core CCA, YCS, and level milestone activities which constitute a series of key events for each level for Catholic students to experience and know God during a significant phase in their discipleship journey. Other Catholic activities include daily prayer ministry in the Chapel, and monthly and obligatory masses for all Catholics. Religious and Moral Education lessons for Catholic students, which are aligned to the CCE curriculum, but delivered with suitable Catholic messages, are also conducted throughout the year.<br><br>Spiritual development for the whole school population involves the whole school in activities such as daily morning reflections and afternoon prayers, as well as school events such as Commencement Service on the first day of school, and Thanksgiving Mass at the end of the academic year. Prayers and reflections shared at these platforms provide regular checkpoints to reinforce the school mission and values in our students.|Catholic parents should encourage their children to participate in Catholic activities, and help their children understand the importance and relevance of their faith to their lives.<br><br>Non-Catholic parents could encourage their children to be open to other religions, culture and diversity, while at the same time encouraging their children to become responsible and contributing citizens/members of the country.|
|Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)|The school inculcates in students, the school values of ‘Humility’, ‘Integrity’, ‘Respect’ and ‘Love’, through CCE lessons. The teachers also conduct lessons on Sexuality Education, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) and Cyber Wellness, to complement the CCE lessons. In addition, students undergo a school-based curriculum focusing on leadership and service development under the school’s Good Samaritan Programme.|Parents may espouse the same set of values at home to help students internalise them. Parents who wish to find out more about the school curriculum for character and citizenship development may refer to the school website or approach the HOD/CCE. Parents could follow up from the modules conducted with their children, and guide them closely in their character development process.|
|Environmental Education|The school encourages students to care for their environment through CCE lessons and Environment Education programmes. Green messages such as “keeping the environment clean”, “returning the cutlery”, “reduce, reuse and recycle” are constantly reinforced through classroom routines and activities. At the end of each day, students undergo LEAD [Love Your Environment, Always Do Your part], in which they demonstrate responsibility by maintaining cleanliness in their classrooms/school daily.|Parents may assist to role-model and reinforce the same messages at home, by getting your children involved in house chores, and emphasising the importance of being civic-minded individuals.|
