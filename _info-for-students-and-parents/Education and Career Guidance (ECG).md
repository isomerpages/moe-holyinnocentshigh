<p>The HIHS ECG programme aims to support students in discovering their interests,
strengths, and aspirations to make informed decisions on their education
and career pathways. This not only supports students in remaining competitive
in the global economy but, more importantly, prepares them to lead meaningful
and productive lives in continual service towards God and society, with
sound values, a good work ethic, and performing to the best of their abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through CCE lessons, small group counselling sessions, workshops, and
experiential learning journeys to tertiary institutions and industry visits,
students are guided to explore opportunities aligned with their values
and goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students can also book individual consultation with our <strong>ECG Counsellor, Ms Seow Wei Ting (<a href="http://go.gov.sg/ecghihs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">seow_wei_ting@schools.gov.sg</a>),</strong> to
discuss their education and career plans via the ECG Booking Link (<strong><a href="http://go.gov.sg/ecghihs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://go.gov.sg/ecghihs</a></strong>)

<br><strong><u>St John Brigade's ECG Learning Journey to Alexandra Hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SJB Students visited Alexandra Hospital to gain insights into the healthcare
industry. They had the opportunity to visit the pharmacy, assist in medication
packing, explore smart wards, and observe how technology enhances healthcare
delivery and patient care. Following the visit, a post-journey ECG workshop
was conducted to help students reflect on their experiences, learn about
various healthcare-related roles, and explore relevant post-secondary pathways</p>
