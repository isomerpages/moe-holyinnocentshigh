<h4><strong>Our Department Mission</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>To nurture passionate and proficient users of the Mother Tongue languages who possess strong moral values and a lifelong appreciation for their linguistic and cultural heritage.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Department seeks to develop confident communicators
and culturally grounded individuals who value their roots and embrace their
identity. Through authentic and engaging learning experiences, we aim to
deepen students’ love for the language, strengthen their connection with
their heritage, and empower them to communicate with empathy and respect
in a multicultural society.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Department Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Department recognises the challenges faced
by 21st-century learners in acquiring and using their Mother Tongue languages.
As such, the department strives to nurture students’ interest and love
for the language through a repertoire of effective pedagogical approaches
that develop their listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. Students
are also provided with opportunities to participate in various MTL-related
competitions to further hone their language proficiency and build confidence
in authentic communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) — the <em>Journalism and Broadcasting Programme</em> —
supports and complements the learning of the Mother Tongue languages in
Holy Innocents’ High School. Through exposure to journalism and broadcasting
within the MTL curriculum, students are able to apply their language skills
in authentic contexts such as journal writing, news reporting, and audio-visual
production, thereby deepening their engagement and appreciation of the
language.&nbsp;</p>
