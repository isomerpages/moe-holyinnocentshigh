### **Student Development Team (SDT)**

Our Student Development Team (SDT) aims to nurture students to be compassionate and morally upright citizens to serve God and Society. Every student in Holy Innocents’ High School is nurtured in a systematic approach, beginning from leading self, to leading people and thinking through our various programmes.

Our programmes comprises components from student social-emotional well-being to a holistic development through our multidisciplinary activities and programmes. Coupled with guidance from the team and our colleagues, our students will go through a meaningful lived experience that will enable them to find their passion and build on their competencies for the future.
