#### **Teaching and Learning Approach**
HIHS science experience is a spiral curriculum across 4 years, and is anchored on the mission to develop students with inquiring and innovative minds with a passion for STEM, empowering them as good samaritans to contribute meaningfully to society, and towards the lives of others. The approach is to encourage student voice and participation, allowing for students to develop interest and skills in Science through scientific inquiry. The focus of the Science experience at various levels are as follows:<br>
●	Sec 1: Introducing Scientific Inquiry<br>
●	Sec 2: Developing Thinking Skills through STEM<br>
●	Sec 3: Promoting Problem-Solving Skills through STEM, and Advocacy for Common Good

The learning of Science in HIHS encompasses lived experiences within and outside of school, introducing students to new ways of seeing and thinking about their learning, competitions to expose students to new ideas and perspectives, science research projects and attachments at post-secondary institutions to help students find relevance and connectedness to learning.
