<p><strong>Identity</strong> 
<br>Together with others in our school and the wider community, I believe
we can become our best selves and contribute to a greater good as a HI
Good Samaritan.

<p>Be <strong>respectful</strong> to others.</p>

<p><strong>Conduct</strong> ourselves with <strong>integrity</strong> and <strong>humility</strong>

<p>Everyone is <strong>unique</strong> and we can be <strong>purposeful &amp; resilient</strong> in
our lives and work towards our goals and dreams.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Relationships</strong> 
<br>Let the relationships that I build be meaningful and filled with empathy
&amp; positivity. May i learn to build trust and be human-centred at work
and play.</p>

both online and offline.</p>

<p><strong>Choices</strong> 
<br>I have the power to make responsible choices, I can choose to respond
with humility, integrity, respect and love in my daily interactions with
others. In doing so, I will learn and grow into a HI Good Samaritan.</p>
