<p>The Arts in Education Programme at HIHS (Arts@HIHS) is one of our signature
programmes and it aims to promote civic, global and cross-cultural literacy
through building students’ awareness and engagement in the various art
forms and cultural expressions of relevant themes. Throughout their four
years at HIHS, students are offered a variety of opportunities in and outside
of school to nurture their artistic exploration, in support of their holistic
development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arts@HIHS Out-of-school Arts Experiences (Cohort level)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every year, students can look forward to enjoying a performance/exhibition
beyond the classroom, offering lived experiences that widen their horizons.
By engaging with the themes and artistry of these professional productions,
students develop a deeper appreciation for the arts and gain valuable insights
that resonate across various aspects of their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Sec 4 and 5 students enjoy a world-class musical as a cohort in celebration
of their graduating year while the Sec 3s visit a prominent art exhibition.
Sec 2 and 1 students take their learning of music and literature outside
the classroom through concert and theatre experiences. In the recent years,
students attended musicals including Matilda and Wicked, exhibitions such
as Studio Ghibli and Singapore Biennale, performances including Perfecting
Pratas and The Boy in Striped Pyjamas, as well as concerts by Singapore
Chinese Orchestra.</p>

<p><strong>Arts@HIHS In-school Arts Experiences</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assembly Programme</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carried out once a term in the school hall for all levels of students
in collaboration with CCE, students appreciate themes like Total Defence
Day and Racial Harmony Day, brought to life through the vibrant mediums
of music, dance and theatre performances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artist Workshops</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These workshops offer students a unique opportunity to enhance their artistic
skills through collaboration with professional artists. Conducted at least
once a year on a sign-up basis, these workshops encourage creativity and
teamwork, with the resulting ideas and art pieces used to redesign and
beautify common areas in the school. This initiative not only enriches
the school environment but also fosters a deeper connection among students
to their surroundings, instilling a sense of pride and ownership in shared
spaces such as the library.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2025, we have the privilege to work with three professionals, which
included the 'Arts Exploration with Technology Workshop' with artist Yeo
Shih Yun in May and 'A Timeless Garden Workshop' with Dawn Koh (paper sculpture
artist) and Gladys Chow (pressed flower artist).</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termly Optional Workshops&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are termly arts-related workshops to cultivate the interest of our
keen arts learners. With a wide range of workshops to choose from, students
are encouraged to explore new art forms&nbsp; to develop new interests
and their artistic and expressive voices. In 2025, some of our optional
workshops included Tinkering for all @Makerspace, Screen-printing Workshop
and Graffiti Style Art Writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibitions and showcases</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our students have numerous opportunities to participate in art and design
exhibitions and music showcases throughout the year. As part of our efforts
to foster growth and excellence in the performing arts CCAs, our students
also showcase their pieces to the entire school. Such platforms nurture
students' interest in creative pursuits, motivate them to refine their
skills, and build their confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
