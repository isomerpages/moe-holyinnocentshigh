### **Parenting Programmes**

At Holy Innocents’ High School, we believe in engaging and working closely together with parents of our students, as parents are the first line of support for their children. Effective collaboration between parents and the school can improve student motivation and contribute to a caring, safe and nurturing environment for each student.

Our school also believes in supporting parents by equipping them with more knowledge and resources to better support, guide and bond with their child, through **talks, workshops and other activities** as well as through the **Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P)**, in collaboration with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and external vendors.

#### **Information on Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P)**

The Triple P programme is an Evidence-based Programme introduced to schools by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) since 2014.

It aims to:<br>
-  Support and empower parents<br>
-  Prevent behaviourial, emotional and developmental problems in children by enhancing parents’ knowledge, skills and confidence<br>

The Triple P Programme is conducted through the following formats:
- Parenting seminars on topics such as “Raising Responsible Teenagers”, “Raising Competent Teenagers” and “Getting Teenagers Connected”
- Consultations and personal coaching sessions tailored to meet individual parents’ specific needs

Parents of Lower Secondary students will be given a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to fill up at the beginning of the school year, in order to match the family with the right format of programme. SDQ questionnaires are to be returned to your child’s form teachers when school begins.

More details about the Triple P Programme will be sent out later this year. For more information, please feel free to contact Mr Justin Seng at [seng\_wei\_jian\_justin@moe.edu.sg](mailto:seng_wei_jian_justin@moe.edu.sg)
