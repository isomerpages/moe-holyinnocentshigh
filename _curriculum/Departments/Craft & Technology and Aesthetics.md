##### **Music Programme:**

In Lower Secondary Music, students develop their understanding and appreciation of music through listening, creating, and performing. They explore music from diverse cultures and genres, learning how music conveys ideas and emotions across time and place. Through singing, playing instruments, and composing with both traditional and digital tools, students build creativity, confidence, and collaboration skills. Authentic experiences—such as exposure to live performances under the Performing Arts-Based Learning (PABL)&nbsp;programme—help deepen their understanding of Singapore’s rich musical heritage and global music traditions. The&nbsp;programme&nbsp;aims to nurture expressive, reflective learners who enjoy music as a lifelong pursuit.

The Upper Secondary Music programme engages students in listening, performing, and composing experiences to develop musical understanding, creativity, and critical thinking. Through the exploration of diverse genres and traditions, students gain deeper insight into local and global musical cultures. The curriculum builds upon foundational skills from Lower Secondary Music and seeks to cultivate independent, reflective, and innovative learners who value music as an essential aspect of human experience. In doing so, it nurtures a lifelong appreciation for the arts and contributes to the enrichment of Singapore’s cultural heritage.

##### **Design &amp; Technology Programme:**

The Design and Technology nurtures&nbsp;design thinkers&nbsp;who appreciate the role of design and technology in everyday life. Through exploring&nbsp;Electronics, Mechanisms and Structures, students learn how products are designed to meet human needs. They develop skills in&nbsp;drawing, sketching and visual communication&nbsp;to express their ideas effectively, and through the&nbsp;design process, build&nbsp;creativity, confidence, and problem-solving skills.&nbsp;

The lower secondary programme focuses on&nbsp;design appreciation&nbsp;and hands-on learning. Students acquire basic design and technology skills and learn to work confidently with&nbsp;tools, machinery and various materials&nbsp;such as wood, metal and plastics. These experiences help them translate design ideas into tangible products and develop practical skills applicable to daily life.&nbsp;

Building on their foundational learning, students at upper secondary levels deepen their understanding of the&nbsp;design process—from research and ideation to realisation—and apply knowledge in&nbsp;Electronics, Mechanisms and Structures&nbsp;to create innovative solutions. They enhance their&nbsp;sketching and rendering&nbsp;skills and are introduced to&nbsp;ICT tools&nbsp;such as 3D CAD modelling and electronic circuit simulators, gaining valuable hands-on experience for future pursuits.
