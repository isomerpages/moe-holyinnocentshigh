<h4><strong>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong></h4>
<p>Learning Support Programme (LSP) at Holy Innocents’ High School has been
designed to help students nurture a positive learning attitude and develop
core self-directed learning skills.</p>
<p>Through coaching and guidance by teachers, identified students are given
additional support for core subjects (EL, Math and Science) via bite-sized
sessions to cope with their academic learning.&nbsp; Students in LSP work
closely with teacher-coaches, who monitor the progress of their academic
subjects and facilitate their reflections. Student reflection is an integral
part of the programme because it allows students to take stock and internalize
their learning for each week as well as over the entire programme duration.
Useful habits of self-regulation are also part of the reflection process.</p>
<p>Selected students will be called up every term to attend study sessions
that prepare them academically for the rigors of written examinations and
equip them with important life skills such as goal-setting, time management
and study habits. They will also receive Education and Career Guidance
(ECG) to develop a growth mindset and a purpose in life.</p>

cope with their academic learning. Students in LSP work closely with teacher-coaches,
who monitor the progress of their academic subjects and facilitate their
weekly reflections. Student reflection is an integral part of the programme
