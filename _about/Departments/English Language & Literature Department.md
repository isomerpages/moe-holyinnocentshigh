### **English Language & Literature Department**

#### **Mission**
To nurture empathetic lifelong learners who are discerning, confident and eloquent users of the English Language

#### **Department Philosophy**
Every student will learn to appreciate the ways in which language is used for different purposes. They are encouraged to develop critical and creative thinking skills while appreciating the beauty of the English Language through the exploration of a range of topics such as self, family, environment, science, culture and human values. Through the study of the 4 language skills, namely speaking, writing, reading and listening, students will be empowered to become effective communicators who are better able to understand and navigate the roles they may embody in the future.
