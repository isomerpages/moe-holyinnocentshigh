<p><strong><u>Positive School Environment</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Holy Innocents’ High School (HIHS), we foster a positive, caring and
inclusive school environment anchored in the Good Samaritan ethos. Guided
by this belief, we nurture students who exemplify compassion, empathy,
and care for the well-being of others. Through a strong culture of care
and positive peer support, every student is equipped with the skills to
support their peers through lessons and their lived experiences in school.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Peer Support Leaders: Nurturing a Culture of Care</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the courage to lead and compassion to serve, our Peer Support Leaders
(PSLs) play a vital role in leading and shaping a safe and inclusive school
culture. They lead student well-being initiatives and advocate for positive
relationships among peers, embodying the school’s Good Samaritan ethos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PSLs strengthen the HIHS identity and students’ sense of belonging through
cohort experiences such as Secondary 1 Orientation programme and student-led
Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons. They also promote
well-being and cyber wellness through regular morning assembly sharings
and student-led leadership training sessions focusing on promoting positive
peer support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In their advocacy for inclusivity, PSLs organise the school’s annual <em>B.E. Inclusive Day (Build Empathy and Inclusive Day)</em> and
partner with external organisations, including a 2024 school-wide presentation
at Holy Innocents’ Primary School in conjunction with The Purple Parade
movement which aims to support inclusion and celebrate abilities of persons
with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the school, PSLs serve the wider community through outreach programmes
such as <em>Christus Natus Est</em> (2023), bringing Christmas festive joy
to children from neighbouring schools — a school initiative that will continue
in 2025. They also champion family values as Family Champions (FamChamps)
by planning upcoming family service projects in 2026 to strengthen bonds
within and beyond the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these collective efforts, every student feels safe, respected,
valued, and supported in their growth.&nbsp;</p>
