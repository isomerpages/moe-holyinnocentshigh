#### **Media / Journalism**

![](/images/media%20journalism.jpg)

The HIHS Journalism & Broadcasting Programme is an established and recognised Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Singapore. The programme aims to develop critical thinkers and confident communicators through a broad-based school wide curriculum and a rigorous and rewarding CCA for selected students. 

With the programme fully integrated with our language curricula, all lower secondary students undergo media training (with focus in Journalism and Broadcasting) in their English and Mother Tongue Languages lessons.

Students who demonstrate strong interest and aptitude in writing and public speaking can join the CCA - Journalism & Broadcasting Society (JBS) and be given specialised training and opportunities to represent the school in various national competitions.

The school has two broadcasting rooms to facilitate the media training of our students. Students also go on learning journeys at media organisations such as Mediacorp and Singapore Press Holdings. We also give students various platforms to participate in some workshops to improve their skills and knowledge in all aspects such as National Translation Workshop at Dunman High School, National Young Shutterbugs workshop at Singapore Poly and Mass Media workshop at NYP. The school also partners Mediacorp, Singapore Press Holdings, Ministry of Education Curriculum Planning and Development Division, English Language & Literature Branch and various primary schools to provide a holistic range of experience and opportunities for the students.

#### **Leadership**

![](/images/leadership.jpg)

HIHS has a long history of programmes catered to the development of student leadership and service. Titled, the Good Samaritan Programme (GSP), the school’s Learning for Life (LLP) programme is centred on the parable of the Good Samaritan which focuses on nurturing servant leaders who lead through service. In line with our school’s mission to nurture in students courage to lead and compassion to serve, we recognise the need to nurture and develop students with talent in leadership to help them realise their fullest potential.

Students will be provided with opportunities to learn and apply relevant knowledge, skills and values that will enable them to contribute meaningfully to the school and community. More importantly, the student leadership talent development programme aims to develop student leaders to become good role models for other students to emulate. With the use of the Leadership Practice Inventory (LPI) as well as the school-based socio-emotional profiling tool, students explore and understand their own interests, strengths, and potential.

Through various workshops and service rendered to the school and community, students will be trained in both hard skills (e.g. situational leadership,
problem solving, facilitation, project management) and soft skills (e.g. socio-emotional competencies, application of the five leadership practices reflected
in the Leadership challenge Model (LCM)). The Student Leadership Board organises an annual Teens Conference, which is an event where student leaders
from various schools together with our students come together to address the current social issues and advocate for the cause.

Upon successful entry into the school through DSA-Sec, prospective student leaders will undergo a mentorship programme where they will be attached to seniors to deepen their understanding of the student leadership culture in the school, as well as to learn and apply leadership skills through observing and contributing to the school and external community. Student leaders will be encouraged to build an individualised **Leadership Talent Development Portfolio** under the guidance of teachers.

##### **Selection criteria:**

*   Performance at Situational Assessment
*   Performance at Interview
*   Past experiences in leadership and service-learning/ VIA

Students who are successful in their DSA-Sec application and are admitted to HIHS in 2022 will go through a two-year attachment programme where they
are exposed to various leadership developmental programmes and other opportunities to serve the school community. Confirmation as Student Leaders will be based on their own merits through their performance in class and over the various opportunities given. We believe that through these programmes and opportunities, students will be able to use the acquired skills in their journey of leadership in various spectrum such as Student Leadership Board, CCA 
and class leadership roles.

#### **Basketball**

     style="width:65%">

The HIHS Basketball team is a force to be reckoned with in the South Zone. Both the B’ Division and C’ Division teams undergo rigorous training and they have been emerging in top zonal positions in recent years.

At the heart of the Basketball programme is Character Development. Through the training and debrief sessions, the basketball players learn about the importance of tenacity and sportsmanship. The strong relationship between the students, coaches and teachers have spurred these young gentlemen to apply their learning in other aspects of their lives.

The Indoor Sports Hall will facilitate better training for our boys.

#### **Modern Dance**

![](/images/modern%20dance.jpg)

The HIHS Modern Dance family is in a class of its own. The versatile girls and boys receive training in various genres of dance, such as contemporary, hip-hop and street dance. The success of the CCA lies not only in the excellent results it produces at competitions. Many of the students who have discovered their passion in dance at the CCA continue to pursue dancing after they graduate.

With the strong partnership between the school and coaches, the students not only develop in dance techniques, but also in their character as well. Students learn to lead, to care and to empathise as they train and plan for events such as concerts. For two years, the Modern Dance group performed to a full-house hall in their concert series, Within Us.

Here in HICO, we strive for excellence in standards and performance, with determination, hard work and help from our dedicated teachers and peers.

In our HICO journey, we learn about different forms of music and traditional instruments. We play not only traditional Chinese music but also western pop songs and other modern music forms. We also form strong and lasting bonds with our members, develop teamwork and leadership skills, and most importantly, have fun!

Our objective in HICO is to bring awareness of Chinese music and instruments to not just the students in HI, but also to the people and community all around as well.
