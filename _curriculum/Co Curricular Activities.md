<br>In Holy Innocents’ High School, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are an
integral part of our students’ holistic education. Every student is required
to participate in one CCA from the following options:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Visual &amp; Performing Arts Group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uniformed Groups</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these activities, students are given opportunities to develop
leadership and life skills and bond with their peers while pursuing their
interests and passion. In addition, students will discover their interests
and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare
them for a rapidly changing world.</p>
