<h3><strong>LLP - The Good Samaritan Project</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Aim</strong></h4>
<p>The focus of the school’s Good Samaritan Programme (GSP) is on student
leadership and Values-in-Action (VIA).</p>
<p>The aim of GSP is to develop each student to be a HI Good Samaritan who
is compassionate and morally upright, through honing their leadership skills,
competencies and values; and nurturing in them a sense of compassion and
commitment towards meeting the needs of the community.</p>
<h4><strong>Student Leadership</strong></h4>
<p>The school adopts Treffinger's (2008) Levels of Service model in our approach
to develop HI Good Samaritans. The following table summarises the four
Levels of Service and the description of experiences available in HIHS
to develop our students into Good Samaritans:</p>

<h4><strong>Activities and Programmes planned by the Student Leadership Board</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>1. Teen Conference</strong></h5>
<p>The school empowers student leaders to lead in various projects and at
different platforms. This includes the annual Teens Conference in which
HIHS invites student participants of other secondary schools to join us
in understanding and addressing community issues through activities led
and implemented by the student leaders.</p>
<p>The past years' Teens Conference saw the participation of some community
organisations who serve as a resource and wealth of experience for participating
students as they identified social causes of community issues they wanted
to address before planning their course of action.</p>
<p>Due to COVID-19, HIHS had its first ever virtual Teens Conference in 2021
through the Zoom platform. The theme was Shine: From Darkness to Light,
and the aim of the conference was to create awareness of community and
social issues, and to develop in youths a sense of empathy that would motivate
them to take social action. The sharing session and panel discussion involving
speakers from various community organisations.</p>

<h5><strong>2. Level Camps</strong></h5>
<p>As part of their leadership development, our student leaders plan and
organise activities for Secondary 1 to 3 camps, with the help of student
camp facilitators. These camps are held at the first few weeks of the year
and the student leaders implement activities that encourage their peers
to bond with one another as well as strengthen their peers’ identity as
part of the HIHS community. These camps provide the student leaders with
opportunities to hone their leadership and service-learning skills.</p>

<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic in the past two years, stay-in camps had not
been possible and camp activities were organised as day activities with
adherence to the Safety Management Measures (SMM).</p>
<h4><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong></h4>
<p>Our Secondary 1 to 5 students are involved in the planning and implementation
of VIA projects using the service learning approach. They carry out a level
thematic project beginning from their most immediate environment (i.e.
family and school) when they are in Secondary 1 to the wider community
at large when they are in upper secondary. &nbsp; Students learn about
the key elements of service learning and initiate projects that are targeted
at addressing the needs and issues of beneficiaries at various levels of
our community. During the service learning journey, students are provided
with opportunities to develop and strengthen their leadership practices.</p>
<p><u>Lower Sec VIA</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Secondary 1 students have the opportunity to set up booths showcasing
games and advocacy movements centered around racial harmony. In managing
these booths that are open to students of all levels during the commemoration
of Racial Harmony Day, Secondary 1 students can build a sense of belonging
while engaging meaningfully with the school community. They exemplify the
school values of love and respect by promoting understanding and mutual
respect among their peers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Secondary 2 students learn about empathy through understanding more
about different special needs during CCE lessons. They then plan and implement
booths featuring games and advocacy activities on Be Inclusive day, an
event that is organised by the SEN and Service Learning team teachers.
Through these initiatives, students can share ideas of inclusivity, reflecting
the school’s values of love and respect as they encourage everyone in school
to be a Good Samaritan.</p>

<p><u>Upper Sec VIA</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Secondary 3 students partner with Morning Star and Good Shepherd under
Caritas Singapore for their Service Learning projects. Through these meaningful
collaborations, the students further develop empathy as they design and
facilitate age-appropriate activities for the children supported by both
organisations. The experience allows them to also develop compassion, creativity,
and a deeper understanding of how they can make a positive impact in the
lives of others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Secondary 4 students implement their Service Learning projects with
beneficiaries such as The National Kidney Foundation (NKF). The partnership
with external welfare organisations allow students to build stronger and
more trusting relationships with the beneficiaries. Over time, they are
able to witness the positive impact of their continued efforts and understand
how consistent service can bring about meaningful change in the community.</p>
