<p>The Mustard Seed Project (MuSP) is Holy Innocents’ High School’s signature
interdisciplinary learning programme. Rooted in the school’s mission to
nurture courageous and compassionate citizens, MuSP engages students in
exploring real-world issues through inquiry, reflection, and authentic
experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year, students investigate a real world issues - for example, how
Singapore manages change and continuity, how communities stay sustainable,
or how technology shapes daily life. They embark on Place-Based Learning
in venues such as the Singapore Maritime Gallery, National Museum, and
National Gallery to engage with key concepts on site, then work in teams
to propose responses to address what they have learnt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Partnerships with creative and industry experts such as STUCK Design and
SUSS Success Centre extend our students' learning experience beyond the
classroom. Our collaborations expose students to design thinking, innovation,
and global perspectives, deepening their understanding of how ideas and
values take shape in the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MuSP Canopy is a learning festival where students share their insights
and learning journeys, celebrating growth in understanding, empathy, and
collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
