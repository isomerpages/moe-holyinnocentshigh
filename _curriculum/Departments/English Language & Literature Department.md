<h3><strong>English Language &amp; Literature Department</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Our Department Mission</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Nurturing empathetic lifelong learners who are discerning, confident and eloquent users of the English Language</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The English Language and Literature Department seeks to nurture confident
communicators, critical thinkers, and compassionate individuals through
authentic and engaging learning experiences. We believe that the ability
to use language effectively in speaking, writing, and presenting empowers
our students to connect meaningfully with others and the world around them.&nbsp;</p>
