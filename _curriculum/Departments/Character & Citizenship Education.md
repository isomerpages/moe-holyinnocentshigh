<h4><strong>Cyberwellness</strong></h4>
<p>The Cyberwellness programmes aims to guide students to take responsibility
for their own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect
for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’
when adhered to will help our students to make careful and well-considered
decisions in cyberspace.</p>
<p>The Cyberwellness curriculum includes lessons and learning experiences,
such as: roadshows and assembly programmes on cyber well-being, a Cyberwellness
advocacy movement by students, and customised training to equip our students
with the necessary skills to adopt healthy cyber habits.</p>

<h4><strong>National Education</strong></h4>
<p>NE plays an important role in developing students' understanding of Singapore
and their national identity. Besides commemorating the four NE events (Total
Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, and National
Day), students have opportunities to learn about various cultures and religions
through learning journeys, assembly programmes, and customised activities
held as part of the regular CCE curriculum. In the process, they will also
have the chance to deepen their understanding of their role as active citizens
in Singapore.</p>
