Journalism and Broadcasting (J&B) at Holy Innocents’ High School (HIHS) has been awarded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) status in January 2015. <br>The school’s mission and vision articulate our aspirations<br> to nurture students who will lead with courage and serve<br> with compassion, guided by our core values of humility,<br> integrity, respect and love. Our ALP in Journalism &<br> Broadcast would grow a generation of students who are<br> critical thinkers who exude confidence and can<br> communicate well.
