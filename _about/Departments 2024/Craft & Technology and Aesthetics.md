##### **Design &amp; Technology Programme:**

The Design and Technology programme aims to develop design-thinking among our students and develop an appreciation of design in everyday life as well as uses of technology (Electronics, Mechanisms and Structures) in products. They learn drawing and sketching skills to enable them to communicate their ideas and thoughts about design effectively. Through engaging in the design process, pupils learn to solve authentic problems and develop resilience, confidence and problem-solving skills.

##### **Lower Secondary Design and Technology Programme:**

Lower secondary programme focuses on design appreciation. Students are introduced to basic design skills as well as uses of technology (Electronics, Mechanisms, and Structures) in products and how they are used to meet our everyday needs. They are also taught basic skills in the handling of tools and simple machinery work with the different resistant materials (woods, metals, plastics) to allow them to realise their product designs. The lower secondary programme provides students with practical skills, creativity, and confidence that they can apply in their everyday lives. Through the lower secondary programme's emphasis on design appreciation, students gain essential skills in basic design and technology. They learn to work with tools and machinery confidently, to successfully bring their product designs to life.

##### **Upper Secondary Design and Technology Programme:**

Upper secondary programme builds on student's foundational studies in the lower secondary programme. Students are also taught in-depth about the design process (Research, Design opportunities, Ideation, Realisation) and technology (Electronics, Mechanisms, and Structures). Students are taught drawing, sketching, and rendering skills to help them express their ideas and thoughts about design. Students are also exposed to ICT tools like 3D CAD modelling and Electronic Circuit Simulators. The upper secondary programme is a continuation of students' foundational studies in the lower secondary program. Students learn to apply the design process - including research, ideation, and realization to identify and solve authentic problems. They also learn about technology, such as electronics, mechanisms, and structures and how they can be applied into their design solutions. Additionally, students hone their drawing, sketching, and rendering skills, allowing them to better communicate their ideas and thoughts about design. With exposure to ICT tools, such as 3D CAD modelling and electronic circuit simulators, students gain practical experience and hands-on knowledge that will serve them well in the future.

##### **Nutrition &amp; Food Science Programme:**

The Nutrition &amp; Food Science programme aims to develop among our students the relevant life skills to independently navigate the wealth of information available to them to make informed choices for everyday living and develop in them positive attitudes that will empower them to make informed food and consumer choices in their daily life. Our pupils are taught many vital skills which challenge their creativity and given opportunities to make informed choices

##### **Lower Secondary-Food and Consumer Education Programme:**
