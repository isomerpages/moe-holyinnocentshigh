**Identity**
<br> Together with others in our school and the wider community, I believe we can become our best selves and contribute to a greater good as a HI Good Samaritan. <br>
* Be **respectful** to others.
* **Conduct** ourselves with **integrity** and **humility**
* Everyone is **unique** and we can be **purposeful & resilient** in our lives and work towards our goals and dreams.
