<h4><strong>Cyberwellness</strong></h4>
<p>The Cyberwellness programmes aims to guide students in taking responsibility
for their own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect
for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’
when adhered to will help our students in cyberspace as they will then
be able to make careful and well-considered decisions. The HIHS continual
emphasis is on making decisions guided by the school values.</p>
<p>The Cyberwellness curriculum include lessons and learning experiences
including roadshows and assembly programmes on cyber well-being, Cyberwellness
advocacy movement by students, and customised training to equip our students

<h4><strong>National Education</strong></h4>
<p>National Education plays an important role in the school’s overall CCE
efforts. Besides commemorating the four NE events, students have the opportunity
to learn about various cultures and religions through learning journeys,
assembly programmes, and customised activities held as part of the formal
CCE curriculum. In the process, they also deepen their understanding of
the role they play as active citizens in Singapore.</p>
