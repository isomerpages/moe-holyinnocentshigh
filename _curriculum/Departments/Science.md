<h4><strong>Teaching and Learning Approach</strong></h4>
<p>HIHS science experience is a spiral curriculum across 4 years, and is
anchored on the mission to develop students with inquiring and innovative
minds with a passion for STEM, empowering them as good samaritans to contribute
meaningfully to society, and towards the lives of others. The approach
is to encourage student voice and participation, allowing for students
to develop interest and skills in Science through scientific inquiry. The
focus of the Science experience at various levels are as follows:
<br>● Sec 1: Introducing Scientific Inquiry
<br>● Sec 2: Developing Thinking Skills through STEM
<br>● Sec 3: Promoting Problem-Solving Skills through STEM, and Advocacy for
Common Good</p>
<p>The learning of Science in HIHS encompasses lived experiences within and
outside of school, introducing students to new ways of seeing and thinking
about their learning, competitions to expose students to new ideas and
perspectives, science research projects and attachments at post-secondary
institutions to help students find relevance and connectedness to learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Science Competitions</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p><strong>Knowgets Creative Lab 2025</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Holy Innocents’ High School co-organised the Knowgets Creative Lab 2025
with the Media Design for Learning Branch (MDL) of MOE’s Educational Technology
Division (ETD). This one-and-a-half-day event brought together students
to create digital content on “Everyday Science”, blending creativity with
scientific understanding. The initiative aimed to deepen students’ interest
in the Sciences while equipping them with digital media literacy and production
skills essential for the future. A total of 11 HIHS Secondary 2 students
participated, collaborating with peers from six other schools to produce
bite-sized educational videos that showcased STEM in Everyday Life. Through
cross-school teamwork, students not only honed their skills in communication,
creativity, and collaboration but also forged meaningful friendships across
schools.&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Intertidal Walk 2025 (for selected Secondary 2 Students)</strong>&nbsp;
<br>A total of 32 Secondary 2 students participated in the programme, which
provided them with an enriching opportunity to explore various ecosystems
and observe the diverse biodiversity that thrives within them. Through
guided walks, students gained firsthand insights into ecological interdependence,
environmental sustainability, and the importance of marine conservation
for future generations. The programme served as both an educational and
experiential platform, connecting classroom learning with the natural world.
It closely aligns with the Lower Secondary Science curriculum, reinforcing
key scientific concepts such as interactions within ecosystems and the
balance of natural systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
