<p>Our annual English Language Week celebrates the joy and power of words.
Through a range of language-related activities, students explore their
individual strengths and gain confidence in expressing themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our English Language Week Highlights include the SingLit Workshops, where
students experiment with creative expression through songwriting, storytelling,
film writing, and literary design. Another popular highlight is our Human
Library, an interactive experience where students “borrow” real people
as living books to hear personal stories from professionals across various
fields such as doctors, lawyers, architects, and reporters. The Orator’s
Challenge and Spelling Bee also provide platforms for students to sharpen
their public speaking and spelling skills while building confidence and
teamwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These experiences encourage students to communicate with purpose, think
critically, and appreciate the beauty of language in its many forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary Literature Theatre Experience</strong>&nbsp;
<br>To extend learning beyond the classroom, our lower secondary students
attend professional theatre performances aligned with their Literature
texts. Recent productions such as <em>Perfecting Pratas</em> and <em>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</em> allowed
students to see the texts come alive, deepening their appreciation of character,
theme, and writer’s style while fostering a love for the performing arts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA)</strong>&nbsp;
<br>The YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA), organised by the YMCA of
Singapore in partnership with the Ministry of Education and the Speak Good
English Movement, provides our students with a platform to develop their
public speaking skills. The competition promotes public speaking in Plain
English as an essential life skill, giving students the opportunity to
sharpen their speaking abilities, build confidence, and learn by observing
proficient speakers. Through PESA, our students refine their ability to
convey clear, sincere, and convincing messages, which is an important hallmark
of effective communication.&nbsp;</p>
