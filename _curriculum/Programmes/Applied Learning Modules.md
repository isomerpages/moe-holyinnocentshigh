<h2><strong>What are Applied Learning Modules?</strong></h2>
<p>Applied Learning Modules (ApLM) are enrichment modules which broaden the
learning</p>
<p>experiences of students and complement the secondary school curriculum
with a focus on the</p>
<p>practical application of knowledge. These modules provide our students
with applied learning</p>
<p>opportunities â€“ learning that involves doing and applying, learning about
the real world, and</p>
<p>learning for life. ApLM also allow students to discover their interests
and strengths and make</p>
<p>informed education and career choices. In particular, ApLM@ITE/ApLM@Poly
provide students</p>
<p>with stronger education and career guidance (ECG) through authentic and
immersive learning</p>
<p>experiences at ITE and the Polytechnics respectively.</p>
<h3><strong>How do students benefit from ApLM?</strong></h3>
<p>ApLM allow students to apply their skills and knowledge through:</p>
<h4><strong>Learning by doing</strong></h4>
<p>When students learn by doing, they are engaged in hands-on, experiential
learning. There is</p>
<p>greater engagement in the learning process, and this results in deeper
learning for students as</p>
<p>they see connections between theory and practice.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning about the real world</strong></h4>
<p>Students are provided with rich opportunities to acquire and apply knowledge
and skills in real-</p>
<p>world contexts to help deepen their learning. This also allows them to
see the relevance of their</p>
<p>learning, which aids in developing motivation and a sense of purpose in
our students.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning for life</strong></h4>
<p>Through ApLM, students start to appreciate the complexities of reality
and experience the need</p>
<p>to imagine possibilities, take risks and try something new or different.
They also learn from</p>
<p>challenges and setbacks when things do not work according to plan or theory.
These are</p>
<p>attitudes and dispositions which they can continue to apply as lifelong
learners.</p>
<h4><strong>ApLM for students</strong></h4>
<p>ApLM modules are made available to all students from Secondary 2 onwards.
To ensure that all</p>
<p>students are provided with an opportunity to participate in ApLM, each
student may be enrolled</p>
<p>in up to three ApLM throughout their secondary school years.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of ApLM:</p>
