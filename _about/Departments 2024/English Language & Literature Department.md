<h3><strong>English Language &amp; Literature Department</strong></h3><h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4><p>To nurture empathetic lifelong learners who are discerning, confident and eloquent users of the English Language</p><h4><strong>Department Philosophy</strong></h4><p>Every student will learn to appreciate the ways in which language is used for different purposes. They are encouraged to develop critical and creative thinking skills while appreciating the beauty of the English Language through the exploration of a range of topics such as self, family, environment, science, culture and human values. Through the study of the 4 language skills, namely speaking, writing, reading and listening, students will be empowered to become effective communicators who are better able to understand and navigate the roles they may embody in the future.</p><h4><strong>Teaching Team</strong></h4><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Head Of Department (HOD/EL)</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Hazel Lee</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Subject Head (EL)</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Alexis Koh</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Subject Head (Literature)</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Divya Raman</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Senior Teacher (EL)</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mrs Esther Tan (Sec 2 EL Coordinator)</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Lim Lee Lian (Assistant Year Head, Lower Sec) <br>Ms Siti Aisyah (Assistant Year Head, Upper Sec) <br>Ms Lynn Quan (Subject Head, CCE)<br>Ms Agnes Chin<br>Ms Gwendolynn Chrissie Tan<br>Mr Jeremy Khoo (Sec 2 Lit Coordinator)<br>Ms Lim Lay Yong<br>Ms Lee Wan Jing Melodie (Sec 3 EL Coordinator)<br>Ms Perng Jiawei<br>Mrs Susanne Ng (Sec 1 EL Coordinator)<br>Ms Vanessa Hew (Sec 1 Lit Coordinator)<br>Ms Violet Ng I-Ling (Sec 4 EL Coordinator)<br>Ms Yvonne Teo<br>Ms Nicole Wong<br>Mr Jeffrey Chua<br>Ms Natalie Soong<br></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Programmes / Projects / Competitions in 2024</strong></h4><p>1.
