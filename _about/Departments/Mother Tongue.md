### **Mother Tongue**

#### **Mission**
To develop students’ interest and love for the Mother Tongue languages and equip them with the language skills and moral values that will benefit them lifelong.

#### **Vision**
Learn, Love and Live MTL

#### **Living our Values**
Humility, Integrity, Love and Respect 谦诚和爱

#### **Department Philosophy**
The Mother Tongue Languages Department recognises the challenges faced by the 21st Century students in the learning of the Mother Tongue Languages and hence aims to develop the students’ interest and love for the Mother Tongue Languages through a repertoire of pedagogical strategies to equip them with the four main types of language skills, which are listening, oral, reading and writing skills. Opportunities to participate in various MTL related competitions are also provided for students to hone their language skills and to increase their level of self-confidence.

The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) which is the Journalism and Broadcasting Programme, supports and complements the learning of Mother Tongue Languages in Holy Innocents’ High School. With the exposure to journalism and broadcasting topics within the MTL curriculum, students are able to transfer their learning of their language skills into actual application of the skills through journal writing, news reporting, audio and video recordings.
