**Philosophy**
<br> In Holy Innocents' High School, our **Identity,Relationships** and **Choices** are shaped by our values and closely guided by the **Good Samaritan ethos.**

**Identity**
<br> Together with others in our school and the wider community, I believe we can become our best selves and contribute to a greater good as a HI Good Samaritan. <br>
* Be **respectful** to others.
* **Conduct** ourselves with **integrity** and **humility**
* Everyone is **unique** and we can be **purposeful & resilient** in our lives and work towards our goals and dreams. 

**Relationships**
<br> Let the relationships that I build be meaningful and filled with empathy & positivity. May i learn to build trust and be human-centred at work and play.
* a. Let me be guided by **respect** and **love** and **take responsibility for my own words and actions** in both online and offline.
* b. Let us give one another the time and space to develop at our own pace.
* c. May I learn to be **inclusive of others** and recognize & celebrate exemplary behaviour.

**Choices**
<br> I have the power to mae responsible choices, I can choose to respond with humility, integrity, respect and love in my daily interactions with others. In doing so, I will learn and grow into a HI Good Samaritan.
* a. I choose to strike a heality balance between work and play as I discover about myself and my goals.
* b. I choose to use **kind words** as I speak so that I build a more inclusive and positive environment.
* c. In any given situation, I have a choice to exercise **moral courage,** guided by **truth, justice** and **integrity.**
