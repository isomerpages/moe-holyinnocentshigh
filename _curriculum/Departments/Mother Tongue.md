<h4><strong>Our Department Mission</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>To nurture passionate and proficient users of the Mother Tongue languages who possess strong moral values and a lifelong appreciation for their linguistic and cultural heritage.</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Department seeks to develop confident communicators
and culturally grounded individuals who value their roots and embrace their
identity. Through authentic and engaging learning experiences, we aim to
deepen students’ love for the language, strengthen their connection with
their heritage, and empower them to communicate with empathy and respect
in a multicultural society.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Department Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Department recognises the challenges faced
by 21st-century learners in acquiring and using their Mother Tongue languages.
As such, the department strives to nurture students’ interest and love
for the language through a repertoire of effective pedagogical approaches
that develop their listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. Students
are also provided with opportunities to participate in various MTL-related
competitions to further hone their language proficiency and build confidence
in authentic communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) — the <em>Journalism and Broadcasting Programme</em> —
supports and complements the learning of the Mother Tongue languages in
Holy Innocents’ High School. Through exposure to journalism and broadcasting
within the MTL curriculum, students are able to apply their language skills
in authentic contexts such as journal writing, news reporting, and audio-visual
production, thereby deepening their engagement and appreciation of the
language.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight Programme</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Our annual Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Fortnight celebrates the rich
linguistic and cultural diversity of our community. Through a series of
immersive and hands-on experiences, students deepen their appreciation
for their Mother Tongue languages and cultures while building confidence
in using the language in authentic contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the two-week celebration, students participate in a variety of
cultural and language-related activities, such as traditional art and craft
sessions, language games, and the popular MTL Singing Competition. Secondary
One students also engage in creative projects such as round fan painting
and tie-dye, where they explore traditional art forms while expressing
their individuality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students further experience the vibrancy of different cultures through
interactive booths, food tastings, and festive highlights such as the Hari
Raya mini carnival. These activities provide opportunities for students
to appreciate the beauty of each culture, from ketupat weaving and traditional
attire displays to multicultural performances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these authentic experiences, the MTL Fortnight aims to foster
in our students a deeper love for their Mother Tongue languages, strengthen
their cultural identity, and nurture a spirit of inclusivity and respect
in our multilingual society.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Performance Exposure (Theatre Experience)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year, our Secondary 3 students have the opportunity to attend professional
Chinese cultural performances through the <em>Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES)</em> (“文化随意门”计划).
This programme aims to enhance students’ interest in the Chinese language
and deepen their appreciation of Chinese culture by providing authentic
experiences in public performing arts venues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, our students have enjoyed engaging performances such
as <em>crosstalk (相声)</em>, which not only showcase the beauty and wit of
the language but also allow students to experience the vibrancy of traditional
Chinese performing arts in an authentic setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through these immersive experiences, students gain a richer understanding
of the language’s expressive power and cultural depth, fostering both linguistic
confidence and a lifelong appreciation for the arts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Script It Right" Chinese Radio Drama Scriptwriting Workshop and Competition&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Script It Right" is an annual Chinese radio drama scriptwriting competition
and workshop, jointly organized by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language
Learning (CPCLL), Singapore Press Holdings' Chinese radio station UFM100.3,
and Holy Innocents' High School. The event is open to students from secondary
schools, high schools, junior colleges, and polytechnics across Singapore
and aims to promote the Chinese language through creative writing and storytelling.
The program includes scriptwriting workshops to hone students' skills and
a competition to recognize outstanding scripts, which are often broadcast
on UFM100.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
