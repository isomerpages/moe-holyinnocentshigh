### **NTerprise Programme**

#### **Holy Innocents’ High School NTerprise Programme**

Holy Innocents’ High School NTerprise Program is a 4-year program that aims to instil confidence and the necessary skills for a Normal (Technical) student to do his or her very best in any endeavour that they wish to pursue.

Though the program is very entrepreneurial in nature, it helps to prepare the student for the challenges and life-long learning attitude that the student needs to adopt in order for them to gain any success; be it in the entrepreneurial field or doing extremely well in a job or pastime that they have a passion in.

The Program’s motto is very simple: It is to ensure that each student just do his or her very best. The program is also guided by a simple framework.

The NTerprise Program has different themes pegged to each developmental year of a Normal (Technical) student in HIHS. Though the student will ultimately go through the schools’ various programs and be developed in many different areas, students will go through a signature program that can package the theme’s learning points of an NTerprise Program

In **Secondary One**, an NTerprise student will learn about self-development and understand his or her strengths and weaknesses.

Students will go through an few weeks’ worth of entrepreneurial training and guided by a business practitioner to develop a Social Enterprise which can be fully developed in school.

In **Secondary Two**, students will learn about team dynamics and understand how to effectively function as they complete a Social Enterprise project.

Students undergo training through Scaffold Program whereby trainers develop students’ creative thinking and breaking fixed mindsets as they try to complete a few self-initiated entrepreneurial projects.

In **Secondary Three**, students will learn more about leadership and understanding how he or she functions in the big business ecosystem. With the partnership of Halogen, students will learn about business leadership through the Network for Training Entrepreneurs Program. Halogen, an institution which is well-known for developing Youth Leaders, will carry out the program for Sec 3 EBS Students and they provide much needed support and guidance to prepare them for the Business Plan competition.

Students also go through certain signature programs, such as NTerprise Overseas Learning Journey which enables the students to conduct Community Activities as well as observe business practices of small and large-based entrepreneurial organisations.

Elective Modules are also a key part of the development of the students as they go through training in school, at ITE or even at the industrial centre itself. This will enhance their understanding of Singapore’s business ecosystem and as a consequence, strengthen their Career Guidance knowledge so as to help them find their passion in life.

In **Secondary Four**, students will be tasked to be mentors to the juniors in the school as they help them prepare for certain special niche events such as Entrepreneurial Competitions or Awareness Campaigns. Under the guidance of Singapore National Co-Operative Federation, the students are able to conceptualize and conduct ground-up initiatives to kickstart their projects.

It is hoped that any NTerprise student that graduates from HIHS will become a key contributing member of society, even if it means that he or she does not set up a business in future. As long as they remember the attitude, skills and values that have been taught during the NTerprise Program, they shall be a successful person in the eyes of many.
