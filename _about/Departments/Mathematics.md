### **Mathematics**

#### **Mission**
*   To instil the love and curiosity for Mathematics in the heart of every pupil  
*   To equip our pupils with the useful mathematical skills which they can confidently apply in their daily lives.

#### **Vision**
Where everyone counts

#### **Living our Values**
Respect, Creativity and Confidence

#### **Department Philosophy**
The teachers in the Mathematics department work towards helping students achieve a level of mastery of mathematics that will serve them well in their life, and for those who have the interest and ability, to pursue mathematics at the highest possible level. We believe in making connections between Mathematics and applications in daily life.

Beyond the learning of mathematical concepts and skills, the cognitive and metacognitive process skills are equally important.  During the lessons, students should have the opportunities to discuss, articulate and explain ideas to develop reasoning skills.  Through the use of problems in real-world contexts in the classroom discussion, students can strengthen their mathematical process skills.  These include mathematical reasoning and making connections between mathematical ideas, between mathematics and other subjects, and between mathematics and the real world.  Students should also have the opportunity to use feedback from assessment to improve learning.

The department has been planning and designing various programmes to cater to the different learning needs of the students.  As the learning of Mathematics is largely hierarchical in nature, the bridging programme has been carried out to provide early intervention to level up numeracy.  Selected programmes have also been implemented to cater to the needs of students who have strong foundation of numeracy and interest in Mathematics, and would like to pursue further. The department is constantly exploring and refining their pedagogy in areas such as flipped learning to better engage our students.
