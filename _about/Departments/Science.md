#### **Teaching and Learning Approach**
HIHS science experience is a spiral curriculum across 4 years, and is anchored on the mission to develop students with inquiring and innovative minds with a passion for STEM, empowering them as good samaritans to contribute meaningfully to society, and towards the lives of others. The approach is to encourage student voice and participation, allowing for students to develop interest and skills in Science through scientific inquiry. The focus of the Science experience at various levels are as follows:<br>
●	Sec 1: Introducing Scientific Inquiry<br>
●	Sec 2: Developing Thinking Skills through STEM<br>
●	Sec 3: Promoting Problem-Solving Skills through STEM, and Advocacy for Common Good

The learning of Science in HIHS encompasses lived experiences within and outside of school, introducing students to new ways of seeing and thinking about their learning, competitions to expose students to new ideas and perspectives, science research projects and attachments at post-secondary institutions to help students find relevance and connectedness to learning.

#### **Science Research Programme and Competitions**
**<u>Inter-school Genetic Modification Advisory Committee (GMAC) Students Challenge 2021</u><br>**

A group of Secondary 2 students designed an infographic poster based on the theme of
“Gene-editing and GMOs”. The group had decided to work on Golden Rice, which is a GMO created
with more Vitamin A content to counter Vitamin A deficiency. Their poster has been sent as an
entry in an inter-school Genetic Modification Advisory Committee (GMAC) Students Challenge
2021, as part of GMAC’s ongoing efforts in educating the public on GM-related issues. It was a steep
learning curve for the 4 students but they took on this challenge with passion and enthusiasm.<br>

**<u>10th International Biomedical Quiz 2021</u><br>**
The 10th International Biomedical Quiz 2021, organised by Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC)
Science and Mathematics Council, is an online quiz which provides a platform for secondary and
pre-university students to develop their aptitude and potential in the biomedical disciplines. The
competition provides opportunities for both independent work and applying critical thinking to
solve authentic medical challenges.

**<u>2021 Singapore Youth Science Fair</u>**<br>
Our lower secondary students participated in the 2021 Singapore Youth Science Fair, in the
Engineering Sciences & Environment Category. 2 teams were awarded the commendation &
accomplishment award for their research efforts. We are proud of their hard work, and the spirit
of resilience and teamwork they have demonstrated in research and experimentation.<br>

**<u>Project SaVE (Sustain and Vitalise Environment)</u>**<br>
In Project SaVE, students apply thinking skills to study science concepts that address environmental
and sustainability issues. They have the hands-on experience of growing their own crops through
soil-based planting, hydroponics and aeroponics, experimenting with new ways to ensure that the
ecosystems thrive in the school.<br>

**<u>Community in Bloom 2021</u>**<br>
The Community in Bloom (CIB) Awards recognises excellence in gardening efforts by community
groups. HIHS achieved the Gold award in 2021 for her efforts in community gardening, which
includes promoting biodiversity in the school, and sustainability efforts by the school community.
Much of the efforts were spearheaded by 2 Hope (2021) over a span of 2 years. They have invested
tremendous time and effort, and used their harvest to be a blessing to the school community. In
2021, students researched and submitted an inquiry report on their comparison between
hydroponic and soil systems for growing vegetables and were recognized at the Singapore Science
Youth Fair.<br>
