In Holy Innocents’ High School, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Every student is required to participate in one CCA from the following options:

*   Visual &amp; Performing Arts Group
*   Sports&nbsp;
*   Uniformed Groups


Through these activities, students are given opportunities to develop leadership and life skills and bond with their peers while pursuing their interests and passion. In addition, students will discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world.
