### **Elective Modules**

#### **What are Elective Modules ?**

EMs have been introduced into the Normal Course to broaden the learning experiences of N(A) and N(T) students and to provide for their varied learning needs and styles. EMs could cover a range of industry niches, opening up possibilities that extend beyond secondary school education.


#### **What are the objectives of EMs?**

The design of an EM should meet one or more of the following objectives :

1\. To extend and build on the learning objectives of existing N(A) / N(T) subjects.<br>
2\. To introduce to a course of study in post-secondary education<br>
3\. To expose students to possible career paths.

#### **How do EMs benefit our students?**

They enable students to make informed choices when pursuing further studies or deciding on a career path. It also allows them to pursue areas of interest that take them beyond the curriculum.
