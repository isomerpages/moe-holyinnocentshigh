<h4><strong>Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Art Programme:</strong></h5>
<p>The Art programme nurtures students' creative dispositions - including
curiosity, openness, and reflectiveness - through engagement with diverse
art forms, materials, and techniques. Learning is framed around broad and
relevant themes that connect art to students' personal experiences and
the world around them, making art meaningful and relatable. The curriculum
also develops students' ability to communicate and express ideas confidently
through visual language while building their personal portfolios. Through
art-making, discussion, and appreciation, students deepen their understanding
of identity, culture, and their place in society.</p>

<h5><strong>Music Programme:</strong></h5>
<p>In Lower Secondary Music, students develop their understanding and appreciation
of music through listening, creating, and performing. They explore music
from diverse cultures and genres, learning how music conveys ideas and
emotions across time and place. Through singing, playing instruments, and
composing with both traditional and digital tools, students build creativity,
confidence, and collaboration skills. Authentic experiences—such as exposure
to live performances under the Performing Arts-Based Learning (PABL)&nbsp;programme—help
deepen their understanding of Singapore’s rich musical heritage and global
music traditions. The&nbsp;programme&nbsp;aims to nurture expressive, reflective
learners who enjoy music as a lifelong pursuit.</p>

<p>The Upper Secondary Music programme engages students in listening, performing,
and composing experiences to develop musical understanding, creativity,
and critical thinking. Through the exploration of diverse genres and traditions,
students gain deeper insight into local and global musical cultures. The
curriculum builds upon foundational skills from Lower Secondary Music and
seeks to cultivate independent, reflective, and innovative learners who
value music as an essential aspect of human experience. In doing so, it
nurtures a lifelong appreciation for the arts and contributes to the enrichment
of Singapore’s cultural heritage.</p>

<h5><strong>Design &amp; Technology Programme:</strong></h5>
<p>The Design and Technology nurtures&nbsp;design thinkers&nbsp;who appreciate
the role of design and technology in everyday life. Through exploring&nbsp;Electronics,
Mechanisms and Structures, students learn how products are designed to
meet human needs. They develop skills in&nbsp;drawing, sketching and visual
communication&nbsp;to express their ideas effectively, and through the&nbsp;design
process, build&nbsp;creativity, confidence, and problem-solving skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lower secondary programme focuses on&nbsp;design appreciation&nbsp;and
hands-on learning. Students acquire basic design and technology skills
and learn to work confidently with&nbsp;tools, machinery and various materials&nbsp;such
as wood, metal and plastics. These experiences help them translate design
ideas into tangible products and develop practical skills applicable to
daily life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on their foundational learning, students at upper secondary levels
deepen their understanding of the&nbsp;design process—from research and
ideation to realisation—and apply knowledge in&nbsp;Electronics, Mechanisms
and Structures&nbsp;to create innovative solutions. They enhance their&nbsp;sketching
and rendering&nbsp;skills and are introduced to&nbsp;ICT tools&nbsp;such
as 3D CAD modelling and electronic circuit simulators, gaining valuable
hands-on experience for future pursuits.</p>

<h5><strong>Nutrition &amp; Food Science (NFS) Programme</strong></h5>
<p>At Holy Innocents’ High School, the Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) and
Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE) programmes equip students with essential
knowledge and practical skills in food, nutrition, and healthy living.
Students learn to select ingredients, plan balanced meals, and prepare
nutritious dishes, fostering independence and responsibility for lifelong
well-being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students also apply learning through hands-on cooking, experiments, and
real-world tasks. By understanding the science behind food preparation,
they develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that prepare
them for future challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
<br><strong>Promoting Consumer Awareness</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students learn to read nutrition labels, evaluate product claims, and
understand food safety. They also explore issues such as processed foods,
sustainable consumption, and ethical sourcing. These experiences help them
become discerning consumers who make wise, health-conscious decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Developing Capability in Food Sustainability</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through practical lessons and creative projects—such as reusing food scraps
in new recipes—students learn to minimize food waste and make environmentally
responsible choices. These activities highlight the link between science,
sustainability, and daily food practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Promoting Food Innovation through Food Science</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are introduced to food product development and explore how scientific
experimentation can create healthier and more sustainable food options.
Learning journeys to industry partners like You Tiao Man and At-Sunrice
GlobalChef Academy expose them to real-world innovation and career pathways
in the food industry.&nbsp;
