<h3><strong>Mother Tongue</strong></h3><h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4><p>To develop students’ interest and love for the Mother Tongue languages and equip them with the language skills and moral values that will benefit them lifelong.</p><h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4><p>Learn, Love and Live MTL</p><h4><strong>Living our Values</strong></h4><p>Humility, Integrity, Love and Respect 谦诚和爱</p><h4><strong>Department Philosophy</strong></h4><p>The Mother Tongue Languages Department recognises the challenges faced by the 21st Century students in the learning of the Mother Tongue Languages and hence aims to develop the students’ interest and love for the Mother Tongue Languages through a repertoire of pedagogical strategies to equip them with the four main types of language skills, which are listening, oral, reading and writing skills. Opportunities to participate in various MTL related competitions are also provided for students to hone their language skills and to increase their level of self-confidence.</p><p>The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) which is the Journalism and Broadcasting Programme, supports and complements the learning of Mother Tongue Languages in Holy Innocents’ High School. With the exposure to journalism and broadcasting topics within the MTL curriculum, students are able to transfer their learning of their language skills into actual application of the skills through journal writing, news reporting, audio and video recordings.</p><h4><strong>Teaching Team</strong></h4><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Head Of Department</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Foo Ling Shui</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Subject Head</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Lim Xuan Han</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Ho Seng Chuan (Sec 1 Level Coordinator)<br>Mr Lim En Sheng Derrick (Sec 2 Level Coordinator)<br>Ms Liu Nan (Sec 3 Level Coordinator)<br>Ms Poh Qiuyan (Sec 4/5 Level Coordinator)<br>Miss Chai Ming Rong (G1/BCL Coordinator)<br>Ms Joyce Chan Shiying (HCL Coordinator)<br>Ms Siti Salmeah (ML Unit Coordinator)<br>Ms Angela Wong Toon Keen<br>Ms Christina Chew Pang Juan<br>Ms Shang Xiaomeng<br>Mr Rohaizat Bin Ramlee<br></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Programmes / Projects / Competitions in 2024</strong></h4><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Applied Learning Programme-Journalism and Broadcasting (J&amp;B)</p></li><li><p>J&amp;B Project Work-making of introductory video clips, radio drama, vlogs, comic drawing, news report writing.</p></li><li><p>CL Reading Programme</p></li><li><p>Mother Tongue Fortnight Cultural Activities</p></li><li><p>Chinese New Year Celebrative Activities</p></li><li><p>Hari Raya Celebrative Activities</p></li><li><p>“2020, Fight Against COVID-19” National Chinese Writing Competition (Consolation Prize)</p></li><li><p>Chinese Challenge 2020 (Entered into Quarter finals)</p></li><li><p>Create Your Own Newspaper Competition (Lower Sec.
