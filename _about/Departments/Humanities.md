### **Humanities**

#### **Department Philosophy**

The study of the 3 disciplines within the Humanities helps each Holy Innocents' High School student to develop future ready skills and dispositions through learning about ourselves, our environment and the world. Students are led to understand and appreciate the complexities of the human condition, and how different factors drive our behaviour, decisions and plans, both historically and in the present. Humanities education in HIHS involves collaborative learning, the use of technology, and authentic learning through various learning activities and learning journeys. Students learn to obtain data and information from various sources, analyse them criticially, and empathise with different perspectives. Every HIHS student will graduate with a deeper understanding of and connection with humanity, our society and the world.

##### **Geography**

Origin: Greek; &nbsp;_geogaphia –_&nbsp;&nbsp;_ge_&nbsp;‘earth’ +&nbsp;_\-graphia_&nbsp;‘writing’

The study of Geography begins as a compulsory subject at Sec 1. Students learn about the earth and how we understand and live in our environment. The highlight of learning Geography is authentic learning through Geographical Investigation, which allows students to undergo the inquiry process that Geographers adopt, to learn the important concepts and skills in Geography. At Upper Secondary, students are offered Elective Geography (as part of the Combined Humanities subject) as well as Core Geography.

##### **History**

_“History is a people’s memory, and without a memory, a man is demoted to the lower animals.” –_&nbsp;Malcom X

The study of History also begins at Sec 1, where students learn to interrogate sources to reconstruct the Past and to appreciate the different arguments and perspectives present in key historical events in the story of Mankind. A key element in the learning of History is through Historical Investigation, where students experience the work of a historian through analysing both primary and secondary sources to reconstruct an understanding of past events. Core History will be offered to cater to the interests of those who desire to deepen their knowledge, understanding and skills in History.

##### **Social Studies** 

Developing informed, concerned and participative citizens.

Students learn about the Singaporean society and how Singapore interacts with the world at large. Through the inquiry-based approach and use of technology, students have the opportunity to collaborate, engage different viewpoints, and hone their critical thinking skills. The Social Studies classroom also develops students' ability to engage empathetically and confidentally with contemporary issues in Singapore and the world.
