#### **Principalâ€™s Foreword 2024**

It is my privilege to welcome you to Holy Innocents' High School. It is my firm belief that at HIHS, all students and teachers are anchored in a Christ-centred community, where values of integrity, humility, respect and love fill our shared experiences. Our school looks forward to journey with all students in their preparation for an adventure of life, where each will carry away precious memories and lessons from their growing-up years at HIHS, into their career paths.

Our school vision, A Christ-centred community with Courage to Lead and Compassion to Serve, reflects what the school prides itself on, which is developing our students to be Good Samaritans who are commited to serving God and society. The school continues the work of nurturing our best talents with an education started by the Catholic fathers in the Punggol and Upper Serangoon area. Thanks to the pioneering fathers' and educators' indomitable faith and steadfast vision, many students from diverse backgrounds now have the opportunity to give back in their community efforts, deepening their understanding of reciprocity in a community of care and love.

In 2024, we praise God for his mercy and grace that the school is once again able to offer students more opportunity to experience the energy, camaraderie and vibrant cohort lived experiences. Together with all in the HIHS community, we are committed to inspiring and nurturing our students, so that they may have the moral courage to make right decisions, walk with radiant confidence and have the tenacity of purpose to be imbued with a loving heart for others.

Thank you, parents and guardians, for choosing Holy Innocents' High School for an education second to none. Each student deserves the best in education, and we are very proud to present young people who have the courage to lead and compassion to serve.
